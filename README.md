Project Title: Advanced CRUD Application with Java and Servlets
Overview
This project showcases the development of a robust and efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application. It's designed to demonstrate my proficiency in Java, Servlets, JDBC, HikariCP (for connection pooling), and the implementation of design patterns like DAO (Data Access Object) and DTO (Data Transfer Object). The application serves as a dynamic platform, capable of handling data persistence and manipulation with enhanced performance and scalability.

Problem Statement
The primary challenge addressed by this project was to create a highly efficient and scalable web application capable of handling large volumes of data transactions. Traditional CRUD applications often face performance bottlenecks, especially with growing data and user base. The objective was to overcome these limitations by optimizing database interactions and ensuring smooth and responsive user experiences.

Technology Stack
Backend: Java, Servlets
Database Interaction: JDBC, HikariCP (for efficient connection pooling)
Design Patterns: DAO, DTO
Frontend: HTML
Database: MySQL
Development Tools: Eclipse, VS Code, MySQL Workbench, Tomcat Server, Git, etc.
Key Features and Functionality
Efficient Data Handling: Utilizes JDBC and HikariCP for reliable and fast database transactions.
Design Pattern Integration: Implements DAO and DTO patterns for a clean separation of concerns and enhanced maintainability.
User Interface: Simple yet functional HTML-based user interface for easy interaction with the application.
CRUD Operations: Robust create, read, update, and delete functionalities, showcasing seamless data manipulation.
Results/Achievements
Achieved significant performance improvement in data processing and retrieval, as demonstrated by (mention any specific metrics or tests you conducted).
Developed a scalable solution that can be adapted for various data-intensive applications.
Enhanced my skills in Java, web application development, and understanding of advanced design patterns.
